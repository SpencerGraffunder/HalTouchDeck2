/*
  The TFT_eSPI library incorporates an Adafruit_GFX compatible
  button handling class, this sketch is based on the Arduin-o-phone
  example.

  This example displays a keypad where numbers can be entered and
  sent to the Serial Monitor window.

  The sketch has been tested on the ESP8266 (which supports SPIFFS)

  The minimum screen size is 320 x 240 as that is the keypad size.

  TOUCH_CS and SPI_TOUCH_FREQUENCY must be defined in the User_Setup.h file
  for the touch functions to do anything.
